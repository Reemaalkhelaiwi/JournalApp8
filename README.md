Journali

is a simple, calm, and glassy journal app I built with SwiftUI.
I wanted it to feel light, clean, and personal — like writing on digital glass.
It’s designed to be distraction-free and relaxing to use. Everything has a soft, blurred look inspired by Apple’s Liquid Glass style. It’s not just about functionality — it’s about mood.

About the app

You can add, edit, delete, and bookmark your journal entries.
There’s also a clean search bar that filters your notes instantly.
If you don’t have any entries yet, the empty screen still looks good — because even “nothing” should feel aesthetic.

Main features

• Create and edit journal entries
• Swipe to delete with a confirmation
• Swipe to bookmark your favorites
• Search instantly by title or content
• Custom lavender color theme
• Full dark mode support
• Uses .ultraThinMaterial for a glassy UI

------
Tech side

Built completely with SwiftUI, no storyboards.
 uses MVVM for clean data flow.
Components are reusable — things like the glass buttons, search bar, and sheet editor.
Every interaction is state-driven and animated smoothly.
